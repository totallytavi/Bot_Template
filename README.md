# DB_Template
This is a template repository. It is used to create new repositories for Discord bots. Please make sure that when you are creating a new repository, you do the following:

1. Delete the `README.md` file and replace it with your own.
2. Delete the config.json and .vscode folder
3. Add the config.json and .vscode folder to the .gitignore file
4. Commit those two changes (you can do this in one commit)

The first step removes this template message if GitHub doesn't remove it on its own. The second and third helps prevent you from leaking sensitive data such as your bot token or other information.
